<!--ID is the identifier of the element, and ID can be assinged to a particular element, and same ID cannot be assigned to a different element-->

<!--Class is used to provide the a single type of stylings to different elements at a time, instead of defining style to each elements manually, by giving a same name to the class for the different element. We can give different names in a class by giving space to it-->

<!-- . is used to assign a class name along with the element. # is used to provide the ID to the element-->

<!-- div is the default Emmet in HTML, type (.className) -->
